# TODO List - Bug Fixes

## Issues Fixed:

1. [x] Fix body-parser deprecation warning (add extended option)
2. [x] Fix authVerification.js middleware (complete implementation)
3. [x] Clean up app.js (remove duplicate exports and misplaced code)

## Summary:

All three issues have been successfully resolved. The application should now run without the body-parser deprecation warning and the JWT authentication middleware is properly implemented.
